# vxwm

vxwm - Versatile X Window Manager for X11 forked from `dwm`.

## About

vxwm represents a significantly enhanced version of `dwm` that maintains its
lightweight nature while offering modular flexibility. Instead of manually
applying patches, you can toggle pre-installed features directly in the
configuration by switching values between 0 and 1, it is all manageable via
`modules.h`.

The defining feature of vxwm is its implementation of infinite tags. While
traditional tiling managers act like a slide projector, swapping one static view
for another, vxwm treats the screen as a viewport over a vast, continuous
canvas. Windows aren't hidden or layered; they exist on an infinite surface, and
you simply move your perspective across it. You can slide your view to find more
space, snap focus to a specific window, or return to the origin using the
homecanvas bind. Even though this sounds complex, this isn't resource hungry and
isn't hard to use.

### vxwm has repositories on

- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/wh1tepearl/vxwm)
- [GitHub (read-only mirror)](https://github.com/wh1tepearll/vxwm)

## Build and Requirements

In order to build vxwm you need the `Xlib`, `Xft`, `Xinerama` header files and some sort of `make`.

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy libx11 libxft libxinerama make
```

Void Linux:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -S libX11 libX11-devel libXft libXft-devel libXinerama libXinerama-devel make
```

Gentoo GNU/Linux:

```bash
doas emerge -av x11-libs/libX11 x11-libs/libXft x11-libs/libXinerama make
```

## Installation

Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/wh1tepearl/vxwm.git
cd vxwm
```

Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (vxwm is installed into
the `/usr/local` namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following commands to build and install vxwm:

```bash
make
# yes, run make first and only then
sudo make clean install
```

## Running vxwm

You will need `startx` utility installed.

Your `.xinitrc` should be something like this to start vxwm using `startx`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

exec vxwm
```

If you want to restart vxwm without losing your session or for hot configuration
reload, add something like this to your `.xinitrc` should be something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

vxwm &
exec sleep infinity
```

And then for restarting vxwm use the rvx utility.

In order to connect vxwm to a specific display, make sure that the `DISPLAY`
environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

```bash
DISPLAY=:1 exec vxwm
```

> [!NOTE]
> This will start vxwm on display :1

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your `.xinitrc`:

```bash
while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
do
	sleep 1
done &
exec vxwm
```

## Configuration

The configuration of vxwm is done by editing config.h and modules.h to match
your preferences and (re)compiling the source code.

### Adding custom keybinds

Add this to `config.h` and replace `yoursillyprogram` with the actual `cmd` that
will be executed in hte keybind (recommended adding it right before keys array):

```c
static const char *yoursillyprogramcmd[]  = { "yoursillyprogram", NULL };
```

If your cmd uses multiple arguments, you should write them like this:

```c
static const char *yoursillyprogramcmd[] = { "yoursillyprogram", "arg1", "arg2", NULL};
```

etc...

And then add this to keys massive:

```c
{ MODKEY|ShiftMask,	XK_u, spawn, {.v = yoursillyprogramcmd } }, 
```

### Modules

Enable/disable (0/1) modules you need/don't need, thats it.

> [!NOTE]
> After any change in config/modules recompile vxwm and restart using rvx.
